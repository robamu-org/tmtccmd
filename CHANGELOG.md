## [v3.0.0rc2] 20.11.2022

- Add `deprecation` dependency to allow marking functions and classes
  as deprecated with a decorator
- Improve test structure
- Improve documentation
- Add decorators `service_provider` and `tmtc_definitions_provider` which
  avoids some boilerplate code when registering definition provider or packet creation
  handlers

## [v3.0.0rc1] 03.07.2022

- Overhaul of application architecture
- Significant simplification of various modules to increase testability
- Test coverage increased
- Reduced number of modules significantly by moving code into the repective `__init__` files where
  possible
- GUI improved, added separate TM listening button
- Documentation improved
- New logo
- Simplified general package structure, remove `src` folder and have `tmtccmd` package and `tests`
  package in repo root
- First CFDP handler components
- Reduce usage of globals. The end goal is to remove them altogether
- Reduce overall number of spawned threads
- Added Sequence Count handling modules

## [v2.2.2]

- Improve internal structure of sequential sender receiver object
- Add some PUS11 Telecommand Scheduling helpers
- Bugfixes for new modules and code

## [v2.2.1]

- Minor fix for CI/CD

## [v2.2.0]

- Improve `lint.py`: Add prefix and print out executed command
- Architectural improvements for the `TmListener` component
  - Separate functions to set the internal mode
  - Moved mode enum outside of class scope
- Call user send callback for both queue commands and regular telecommands

## TmTcHandler

- Added a cached `SequentialCommandSenderReceiver`
- Added `CONTINUOUS` mode which will start the receiver thread in the 
  `SequentialCommandSenderReceiver` instance and only send one TC

## Runner module

- Added argument in `__start_tmtc_commander_cli` to defer sending of command
- Added two functions, `init_and_start_daemons` and `performOperation`, to allow
  separate calls to initiate the TmTcHandler and send TCs

## SequentialCommandSenderReceiver

- Added `send_queue_tc_and_return` function which does only that (and no TM checking)
- Added possibility to start a thread which checks TM

## [v2.1.0]

- API consolidation for PUS TCs and TMs. Unified the API and made it more consistent

## [v2.0.1]

### Fixed

- Bugs in examples

## [v2.0.0]

### Changed

- Improve core API: Changes core functions to setup and run. Requirement to user to create backend.
  Makes it easier to directly configure the backend and move to a generally more pythonic API
- Refactoring and extending file logging functionalities
- Exposes functions to create a raw PUS logger and a TMTC logger
- Refactor modules to move packet printout and logging to user level
- Simplified hook object, removed 2 static PUS handlers
- Updated CCSDS Handler to make it more easily extensible by creating a new ApidHandler class
- New Pre-Send Callback which is called by backend before sending each telecommand

### Added

- Parsing functions to parse the CSV files generated by the FSFW generators.
  Includes event, object ID and returnvalue files. These parsing functions
  generate dictionaries.
- New function in Hook base to return return value dictionary

## [v1.13.1]

### Fixed

- Return the config dictionary for op codes

## [v1.13.0]

### Added

- New dependency `prompt-toolkit`
- Auto-Complete feature for service and op-code selection using the `prompt-toolkit`
  packaged

### Fixed

- Added missing super constructor call for HkReplyUnpacked
- Extended Op Code options functionality and actually use it. Allows to set custom timeout
  or and enter listener mode for certain op codes

## [v1.12.0]

### API Changes

- Renamed some TM packets to make it more explicit that these TM handlers are tailored
  towards usage with the Flight Software Framework (FSFW)

### Added

- Better handling for scalar parameter telemetry for service 20. Emit better warnings for
  unimplemented cases

### Others

- Bumped some package requirements.
  - `colorlog` >= 6.6.0
  - `spacepackets` >= 0.6
  - `pyserial` >= 3.5
- Renamed example folder

### Fixes

- GUI example fixed

## [v1.11.0]

### API Changes

- Improved API to specify handling for Service 3 and Service 8 packets in user hook object

## [v1.10.2]

- New API to build service/opcode dictionary
- Fixes for Service 8 Telemetry Parser

## [v1.10.1]

- Applied consistent formatting with `black` tool
- Some bugfixes for PUS packet stack
